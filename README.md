Boot Camp Homework Assignment 4

I was able to get to the point of:

- Generating questions by altering HTML using Javascript objects,
- Pulling the questions and multiple choice selections for arrays
- Create buttons from the multiple choice seclection of arrays
- Return the value the user selected and compare the selection to the answer key
- Keep a running timer
- Deduct from the timer if incorrect answer
- Pause the timer at the end to maintain user score
- Create a text input for initials

I was hung up at the very end as I was unable to get my Submit initial button to work. My next steps would have been:

- Using JSON, append the initials to local storage along with current score
- Pull the array from local storage and display on highscores.html
- Create buttons to go back to the quiz or clear high scores
